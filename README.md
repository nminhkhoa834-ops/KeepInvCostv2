# KeepInventoryCostPlugin

KeepInventoryCost is a Minecraft server plugin that allows survival players to keep their inventory and experience levels after they die.

If a player dies and has enough money in their bank, the configured amount gets automatically paid and the player keeps all their items and xp.

## Download

Download is available [here on Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/Kesuaheli/KeepInventoryCost), the plugin hosting site by PaperMC.

## Usage

After adding the plugin `.jar` to your [Paper Server](https://papermc.io)s `plugins/` folder <i>(and resarting the server)</i>, KeepInventoryCost is ready to go.  
<u><b>By default everyones personal keep inventory setting is disabled.</b></u> To enable your personal keep inventory simply run `/keepinventory set true`. Now, if you die, you automatically charged the amount of [the cost setting](#cost). All your items and experience levels are saved in your inventory and will not be dropped. You will also receive an [info message](#messagedeathpaid), saying you have been charged to keep your inventory.  
If is not possible to withdraw from your bank account (for example your balance is too low), you will receive an [information message](#messagedeathno_money) and all your items and xp drop like normal.

## Requirements

KeepInventoryCost needs a [Paper Server](https://papermc.io).

You also have to have the [Vault plugin](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and a economy plugin of your choice already installed in order to connect to the users balance. Otherwise the plugin will automatically disable

## Building

If your environment cannot run Maven locally, you can use the included GitHub Actions workflow to produce a build artifact automatically after you push the repository to GitHub.

Local build (recommended):

```powershell
# Ensure JDK 17 is installed and JAVA_HOME points to it
mvn -DskipTests package
# The JAR will be in the target/ directory
```

Build on GitHub (no local setup):

1. Commit and push this repository to GitHub (for example to the `main` branch).
2. Open the repository on GitHub, go to the `Actions` tab and run the `Build KeepInventoryCost` workflow or wait for it to run on push.
3. After the workflow completes, go to the completed run and download the `KeepInventoryCost` artifact which contains the built JAR from `target/*.jar`.

Notes:
- The repository includes `.github/workflows/maven.yml` which builds using Java 17 and Maven and uploads the artifact.
- The server must run Java 17 for Minecraft 1.21+.
